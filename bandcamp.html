		<div class="headline2">About the project</div>
		<p>This project was made as a part of the course Interaction Design methods at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It was done during a 10-week period of time and was centered around the improvement of an existing music application based on a specific user group.</p>
		<p>I was part of a team of four students with equal responsibilty on how the project would realize. I was very much involved in every step of the process and gained a lot of experience in every step of the design process.</p>

		<div class="headline2">Design process</div>
		<p>We followed a user-centered design process to figure out how the system could be better aligned with user goals, becom more pleasureable to use and harness the power of its medium better.</p>

		<div class="headline2">Challenges</div>
		<p>When researching Bandcamp we found that young people doesn’t use Bandcamp that much. This made us want to focus on Generation Z as a user group.</p>
		<p>We also found that Bandcamp users rarely discover any music on the platform. Instead, they find music elsewere and purchases the music from Bandcamp.</p>

		<div class="headline2">Solutions</div>
		<p>We were able to merge two ideas from two different methods into one feature.</p>
		<p>How might we emulate the feeling of getting a tape from a friend?</p>
		<p>+</p>
		<p>Sending out physical tapes to users with music recommendations.</p>
		<p>=</p>
		<p>A feature where you can send and receive tapes digitally.</p>

		<div class="headline2">Reflections</div>
		<p>This was a very educative design process. However, everything rarely goes as planned and flexibility in regards to the design process was needed. Some important takeaways from the project were; the importance of using predecided methods,
		crafting a design that aligns with a company’s values,
		realizing that design isn't an optimization problem and
		using interactivity as a destination rather than only as a means to an end.</p>
