		<div class="headline2">Background</div>
		<p>Today, everything we do is being monitored, often with corresponding numbers to represent our actions. For example the number of steps taken per day is measured with a specific number, where the infamous 10,000 steps mark is well known.</p>
		<p>What if we, instead of using numbers to represent our actions, use visualization to show us what kind of actions we've taken part of as of lately?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Conceptual design</div>
		<p>The actions I'd like to focus on are actions that are important to everyday life. Such as, movement and energy consumption.</p>
		<p>Each type of action would correspond to a specific form of visualization and how it would be realized would be directly decided by the everyday actions done by the user.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Action mapping</div>
		<p>One challenge is how to map a form of action to a visualization and how it would change depending on the amount of the action.</p>
		<p>To make the visualizations interesting is crucial to the outcome of the design.</p>
		<p>I decided to let colors and activity on the screen correspond to changes in action.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Movement</div>
		<p>The movements would be visualized using colors ranging from darker, representing little movement, to lighter, representing a lot of movement.</p>
		<p>The amount of movemement would also be represented by the amount of randomized dots drawn on the screen.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Energy consumption</div>
		<p>The Energy consumption would also be visualized using colors but this time ranging from green, representing low energy consumption, to red, representing high energy consumption.</p>
		<p>The number of dots on the screen would here correspond to the amount of energy consumption from the user.</p>
