		<div class="headline2">Background</div>
		<p>During this project, made with KTH Royal Institute of Technology, our goal was to understand how to link artistic expression and fidgeting.</p>
		<p>In order to do this, we tried to create a visual generative art experience linking digital art with a physical object users could interact with.</p>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Ideation</div>
		<p>During the past year, I've been exploring the world of generative art using processing among other tools. This led me to think of the possibility to create a physical device that generates art while fidgeting with it. This resonated well within the group and we decided to pursue the idea.</p>

		<p>Thus, the goal was to design a device that brings a creative, fidgeting experience to the user.</p>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Sketching and research</div>
		<p>Figuring out how to create a device that provides novel forms of interactions and still are pleasurable to use was challenging.</p>
		<p>We dove into research related to interactive art to find out how the interactions and the art would relate to each other while also sketching out multiple formats of the device.</p>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Physical prototype</div>
		<p>We built a physical prototype using cardboard and loose buttons to get a feeling for the possible interactions and for the form of the device.</p>

		<div class="headline2">Interactive prototype</div>
		<p>An interactive prototype was made using the electronic components and the software we would use in the final device.</p>
		<p>This made room for a more real experience in terms of the interactions and made it possible to perform some initial user testing.</p>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Design requirements</div>
		<p>The design of this device consisted of two main areas, software and hardware.</p>
		<p>The software needed to generate art on a screen was realized using processing that used an algorithm I developed to generate different forms of art based on the user interaction.</p>
		<p>The hardware part was built using an arduino communicating to processing and a case built out of wood.</p>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Final product design</div>
		<p>For the final device we used soft materials such as foam and fabric to make the device nice to touch and comfortable to fidget with.</p>
		<p>We made touch sensors with fabric and a pressure sensor with foam to let the user interact with different materials.</p>

	<div class="gridworks2">
		<div class="headline2">Conclusion</div>
		<p>The final design made it possible to generate art by fidgeting with the device. Thus making it possible for users to create generative art without writing a single line of code. This could make the creation of generative art available to a new set of people who lack the technical knowledge to create generative art from scratch.</p>
